What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, then a hidden folder named .git appears in the same directory.
This shows that now the directory has become a git repository.
We need to do it because otherwise it will just be a plain directory and not a repository and as such wont be able to save our version history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different from both the working directory and repository as it acts as an intermediate. Whatever files we want the commit
to have is stored in the staging area. This is the value it offers.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Whatever changes we make to our project, we can come back to our Git BASH and add those files to the staging area straight away to commit the changes.
This will help us to commit change per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When we want multiple versions of our project, like suppose one for french langauge, one for indian and all that, so branching can help us
to maintain separate history for each.
Branches can exactly tell us in which branch we made which change and how to revert that and all.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams always helps to understand the tree structure better. As we know pictures (diagrams) speaks louder than words!
It can show us from where a branch shooted off and till where the branch was on!
