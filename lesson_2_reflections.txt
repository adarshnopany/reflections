What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, then a hidden folder named .git appears in the same directory.
This shows that now the directory has become a git repository.
We need to do it because otherwise it will just be a plain directory and not a repository and as such wont be able to save our version history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different from both the working directory and repository as it acts as an intermediate. Whatever files we want the commit
to have is stored in the staging area. This is the value it offers.
