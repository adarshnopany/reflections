When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

We will want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local when
I want to submit all my changes in the internet SPECIFICALLY for public viewing,
so that they can review my code and possibly administer changes to it. This is it!


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That is because there might be cases when we are just testing something with our code in GitHub and are not yet ready to
send our changes to our local machine, so its good for Git not to automatically pull all changes from GitHub to my local
computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  
When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used when we copy one Repository from GitHub onto GitHub.
Clones are those when we copy one Repository from GitHub onto our local machines.
Branches are those which are new commits made in the same Repository.
Its pretty evident when we will use which option.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
